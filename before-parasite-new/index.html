        </h1>
        </section>
        <section class= "item2">
        <p class="about"> South Korean entertainment has been gaining 
           international attention thanks to the increased popularity of 
           Korean pop culture. Korean cinema has also come into the spotlight with 
           “Parasite”, directed by Bong Joon Ho, when it became the first non-English 
           film to win the Best Picture Award at the Oscars in 2020. The film also 
           received several other accolades at the Oscars, amassing a total of 5 awards, 
           and received the Palme d’Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2019. </p>

         <p>“Parasite” is undoubtedly deserving of its high praise and a source of pride 
         for South Koreans. However, as Bong Joon Ho says in his speech when accepting 
         the award for Best Motion PIcture—Foreign Language:</p>
         
         <p id="quote">“Once you overcome the one-inch barrier of subtitles,  you will be introduced 
         to so many more films.”</p>
         
         <p>Before Parasite’s goal is to introduce its viewers who might be new to South Korean 
         movies to a few films that are just as (and some in my opinion more than) provoking 
         and poignant that were created before Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite”.
