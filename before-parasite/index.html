                <p>South Korean entertainment has been gaining international attention thanks to the increased 
                    popularity of Korean pop culture. Korean cinema has also come into the spotlight with “Parasite” 
                    (기생충), directed by Bong Joon Ho (봉준호), when it became the first non-English film to win the 
                    Best Picture Award at the Oscars in 2020. The film also received several other accolades at the 
                    Oscars, amassing a total of 5 awards, and received the Palme d’Or at the Cannes International Film 
                    Festival in 2019. </p>
                   <p>“Parasite” is undoubtedly deserving of its high praise and a source of pride for South Koreans. 
                    However, as Bong Joon Ho says in his speech when accepting the award for Best Motion PIcture—Foreign Language:</p>
                    <p>“Once you overcome the one-inch barrier of subtitles,  you will be introduced to so many more films.”
                    Before Parasite’s goal is to introduce its viewers who might be new to South Korean movies to a few films 
                    that are just as (and some in my opinion more than) provoking and poignant that were created before 
                    Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite”.</p>
