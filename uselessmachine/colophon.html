        “Love Letters from Every Asian Fetishizer” depicts the messages 
        Asian women are probably accustomed to getting particularly in online spaces. 
        These creepy messages are unfortunately not uncommon and Asian femme bodies are told to take it as a compliment. 
        However, much of what the “fetishizer” is saying is usually a huge 
        generalization that showcases very limited knowledge of East Asia 
        and Asia as a whole. It limits our identity down to sushi, boba, K-Pop, 
        and anime. Somehow this mindset gives them permission 
        to send disturbing messages that hypersexualize Asian femme bodies.
        I guess we're supposed to be happy about it though and take it as compliments.
